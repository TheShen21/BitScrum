    <h3>What is Typeracer?</h3>
    <p> So, you want to know what Typeracer, right? Well, Typeracer is a game that test how fast your typing skills are.
        However, on our website, we have you write stings of code instead of words and/or phrases. The reasons why are
        simple. First, we want to stand out from the crowd and not do what the others do. And second, we want to train
        you into becoming a programmer yourself, because we think that being a software developer is the best occupation
        for this current generation.

        <h3>Types of code that you'll learn here.</h3>

        <p> As already mentioned, it isn't just our priority to make you a fast typer, but to also make you a good
            coder. Here are some of the types of code you'll learn as an example. HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL and PHP.
            Javascript is all about the
            interactivity of your website. For example, say you have two photos. You click on Photo one and a smiley
            appears. However, if yo click right afterwards on photo two, the smiley will "teleport" from photo one photo
            two.</p>

        <h3>HTML</h3>

        <p> HTML is the type of code that is used to build websites for example. It allows you to write articles, link
            to other websites and put up images to make everything more lively.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>CSS</h3>

        <p> CSS is the cosmetic part of your websites. It allows you dictate what color you website represents, what
            type of font is used in the letters
            that are seen on your website and how big those a for mentioned photos are.</p>

        <h3>Javascript</h3>

        <p> Javascript is all about the
            interactivity of your website. For example, say you have two photos. You click on Photo one and a smiley
            appears. However, if yo click right afterwards on photo two, the smiley will "teleport" from photo one photo
            two.</p>

    <h3>SQL</h3>
    <article>
        <p> SQL is what is used to create databases and store information on it. This allows you, for example, to keep
            track
            of how many people have played your game and how many are currently playing, as well as check as to who you
            have
            banned from playing.</p>
    </article>
    <h3>PHP</h3>
    <article>
        <p> PHP is the hidden side of your website. On like the other types of code mentioned, PHP cannot be seen by the
            user if they view the sourcecode of your website. It also prevents "lazy people" from completely copying you
            and
            pretending that they are the ones who did all the hard work.</p>
