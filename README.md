# Milestones 

We will work in 1-week sprints, meaning four sprints per month. After each sprint we will be giving the team lead role over to another member of the team. 

 

This is our planning in an average-case scenario. 

Week 1: Roles have been assigned and we have clear goals for the near future. 

Week 2: We have a basic website with an introduction page connected to an empty database. 

Week 3: A basic version of Typeracer where you can see the words on the screen and get an error when you make a mistake. 

Week 4: A finished product  

Week 5: Ironing out any smol mistakes and bugs we find while testing. 

Week 6: Preparing for and giving our final presentation.
